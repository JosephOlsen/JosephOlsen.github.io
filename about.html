      <p class="text-justify">I'm a creative writer with a passion for storytelling that balances comedic tone with rich thematic elements. In my work, I strive to articulate my own experiences while advocating for diversity and facilitating the creation of a more inclusive environment in entertainment and media. When entering new environments, my excellent communication, ability to earn trust, and dedication to teamwork guides me to positions with continuous growth and greater responsibilities.</p><br>
      <p class="text-justify">My professional background in engineering has given me a unique approach to the creative process of storytelling and creative development. I am able to analyze stories as mechanisms with complex components all working together to drive a main theme. I have spent years being trained and training others in the art of live improvised comedy. My love for improv is rooted in its demand for team building skills, earnest listening and honesty, and helping others to grow. It's also just fun to make people smile.</p><br>
      <p class="text-justify">Currently, I work as a Hardware Support Engineer for Amazon's Research and Development Center, influencing the design of innovative prototype machinery. My successes include driving an increased output and quality of team documentation as well as the optimization of machine settings to yield higher quality throughput.</p>
